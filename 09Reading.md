Day 9:
SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) procedure (specific to a company or org) that describing necessary activities to complete a specific task. SOP’s can come in long or short form, be well or poorly written, and, when done poorly or not at all, can have disastrous outcomes. 
Acoriding to the writer, there are 3 types of SOP’s to work with. 
1. Policy - answers “why?” provides broad overarching guidance
	2. SOP - answers “what, when, and why”. What needs to be done when does it need to be done, and why is it being done. There may be multiple SOPs that support a specific policy.
3. Work Instructions - answers “How”. A work instruction (WI) provides the step-by-step directions for accomplishing a particular task. There may be multiple sets of work instructions that support a specific SOP.

Why so SOPping Important:
This answer is three-fold. 
	1. If you want to implement or enforce a policy, an SOP is a main way to do that.
	2. They help steer an organization to achieve a mission, vision, and/or goals.
	3. Encouragement of consistency in execution, critical in demonstrating compliance w/ or achievement of target description in a service level agreement.

How SOP Can Be a Real Challenge.
Because there are no hard and fast rules for writing SOPs, they can vary from one organization to another. Also if not regularly maintained, SOPs become obsolete quickly. Business are always growing and evolving and as a result, IT is also ever-changing and evolving.

Considerable Considerations.
SOPs need to be:
	1.Readable - Meaning legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace
	2. Consumable - using a predeficed format (template) makes the contect neat and easy to read
	3. Understandable. Must be focused and to the point, with relevant and simple terms.	
	4. Actionable - needs to describe what is about to be done in a clear method
	5. Measurable - The activities described must be specific.


Make A Plan.
First start by making a simple flowchart to map the activities of the procedure from start to finish. Then combine closely-related topics, making the SOP concise and readable. The most usable SOP will be one you plan out and keep not to long (making it a slog to read) or to short (not enough info and its useless). The sweet spot is 5-7 steps per SOP. Be sure to add a brief opening overview paragraph that describes the topic of the SOP. 

I could use a guide. How about you?
Keep it simple. 
Keep it portable.
Tell a story through flowcharts and diagrams. 
Keep it consistent throughout.
Keep it for the audience
