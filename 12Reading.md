***My pfSense is tingling;***

pfSense is a free, customized distribution of FreeBSD that turns old PCs into a router and firewall. Created in 2004 as a fork of the m0n0wall project with the main difference being that pfSense is installed on PCs instead of being embedded in devices, this allows for more flexibility & features. pfSense is so flexible that it can be a home router or a firewall for a large corporate network. Easily installed and maintained offering a useful web based user interface. And includes many features that are often only found in expensive commercial routers. 
Some of the most popular uses include:
1. LAN/WAN Router
2. Internet Cafes
3. Wireless Hotspot (Captive Portal)
4. VPN Router
5. Firewall
6. DHCP / DNS Server
7. Wireless Access point
8. Transparent Squid Proxy Server
9. Multi Wan Router or Load Balancer
10. DNS Blacklist
11. Port Forwarding / NAT (Network Address Translation

***pfSense over Router? Why?***

pfSense is fast, free, and stable with lots of features. As you have full control of the hardware you can make the pfSystem to your specific specs. Most routers and firewalls with the same capabilities are expensive to make happen so pfSense can potentially save one lots of money.

***“Whaa!!!, my system is Embedded”***
I hear you say, Well pfSense can be installed on several embedded platforms. Furthermore embedded installs are a good option if you are creating a small quiet, low power appliance to run your network. Consultants are far more likely to set up an embedded pfSense device for a customer instead of as an old PC. just remember to download and install the embedded version of pfSense. The embedded version uses compact flash for storage and performs tweaks that extend the life of the storage media.

The Default address for pfSense is http://192.168.1.1.
