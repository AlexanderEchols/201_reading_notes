## **Day 4:**

***Troublemiss, Troublehit, no Troubleshoot:***

In this lesson we are discussing the beauty that is Troubleshooting. This is something that is done by just about everyone, everyday.  So it is a good idea to actually know what some of the steps are. 
The first step in the process is to gather as much info as possible (knowledge is power) and, if possible, duplicate the problem (this is my fav way to gather intel. Let me break it too). Also be ready for multiple problems, espically when dealing with technology. ALWAYS DOCUMENT AS YOU GO. it is always good to ask the user of the tech when possible, if it was working and now it is not then ask what has changed. 

next is to establish a theory: make a list of the possible causes and work your way through the list solving the easiest parts first. which leads us into part three

Testing the theory. this will either confirm you hypothosis or it won't. if it doesn't the re-establish a new theory and if that fails (as has every other theory you had on your list) then you may wish to call someone smarter (more well versed) in order to solve the problem. If your theory has been varified then you determin the next steps and DOCUMENT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE.

Now that you know what is wrong, it is time to build a plan of action. your plan should correct the issues w/ minimum impack and you may need to wait till production hrs are over. during this point you also want to id any potential effects and have multiple backup plans. (hope for the best, plan for the worst)

Now is the time to implement your solution. at this point you simply need to follow your plan.

after you have implemented the solution, it is time to verify functionality. Take the time to test and make sure all the problems that you originally went in to fix, are infact fixed, and you didn't cause any new problems. It is also a great idea (do it) to implement preventative measures if at all possible.

at this point you should take all the documentation you have been collecting and put it together, save it for future reference.
