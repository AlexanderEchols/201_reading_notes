## **Malware!! The power of Gates compels you:**

Before we can remove it, we must see it. Look for signs your PC is infected. Signs like, slower0 than-usual performance, a sudden spate of pop-ops, other anomalous issues. Follow the steps below to fight the good fight. 

1. Enter safe mode: to do this hold shift and press reboot, when the full screen menu appears select “Troubleshooting > advanced options > startup settings > restart > number 4 (unless you want the network for scanners and such, then select number 5)” if you notice your PC running faster in safe mode it is a “safe” (see what I did there) bet you have either a malware infection or a lot of legitimate programs that normally start up alongside windows.

2. Delete Temporary files: once in safe mode, delete temporary files then run a cirus scan. Doing so might speed up the cirus scanning, free up disk space, and git rid of some malware. This can be done using the Disk Cleanup. 

3. Download malware scanners: if you already had an antivirus program active you should use a different one for this scan as your currently running one may have not detected the malware. This can be achieved using either a real-time antivirus program(one that runs in the background and constantly watches for malware) or an on-demand scanner(searches for malware infections once you open the program manually and ran a scan. Best practice is to only have one real-time scanner, however you can have several on-demand scans.

4. Run a scan w/ malwarebytes. This is an on-demand scanner

5. Fix your web browser: check the web browser settings and connection setting to make sure your browser’s homepage is not being modified.

6. Recover your files if Windows is corrupted: so If all else fails and you can’t remove the Malware, we can always enact the final solution. Copy all of your files to an external USB or flashdrive, If you use an email client make sure you export your settings and messages to save them, then back up the device drivers, and then wipe the hard drive and reinstall windows. 

7. Keep your PC clean: make sure you have a real-time antivirus program running, keep your programs up-to-date, you may want to consider using free OpenDNS services to block dangerous sites. And if you frequent bad sites(not smart, but may be unavordable) you may want to run your browser in a sandbox mode to preventt any downloaded malware from harming your system. Look into Comodo (antivus with sandbox features) or a free third-party program like Sandboxie
